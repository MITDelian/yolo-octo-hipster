=================
pre-set-up:
  install node and npm
set up:
  npm install
  node node.js
use:
  visit localhost:3000
  to send messages, within the web page run `sendRequest({data:"data"})`
  or visit /ping to send a demo request
  if you open a second web page, you can see that each page echoes all requests to the server
  or just look at the node console log :P
